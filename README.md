This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of labeled data for an image classification task. It uses Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and OpenCV to load, process, and analyze the dataset. The data is then represented using clear and informative visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, to understand the label distribution.

Improvisations:
- **Debugging**: Added progress updates while processing categories and checks to alert if no images or labels are found.  
- **Visualization**: Added a clear bar chart and made the pie chart more dynamic with slice separation , better colors, and outlines.  
- **Readability**: Improved chart titles, labels, and font sizes to make everything easier to understand at a glance.  
- **Custom Colors**: Used a consistent color palette to make the charts visually appealing and cohesive.  
- **Data Insights**: Included printouts for the number of images, labels, and DataFrame shape to give a quick snapshot of the data.
